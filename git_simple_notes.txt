If it shows U -> then it is an untracked file.
If it shows A -> it has been added to the staging area.

If it shows M -> then it has been modified after being added to staging.
--> therefore it gets copied to the modified area.

Note:
Whenever we have doubt that we will need the current version 
of our files as they are, we will commit. 

The commit is a snapshot of the current version of our project.

We also give an intuitive message to the commit so that we
understand which changes we did in that commit.
