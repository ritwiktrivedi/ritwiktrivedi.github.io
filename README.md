Hi is my github pages profile -> It is static as github only allows us to host static sites.
(Although... one may be able to run dynamic stuff by using something like VuePress Static Site generator but I am still working on this...)

Feel free to fork. The website is simple HTML and CSS for now. I will use Hugo or VuePress if the scale of this website increases.
